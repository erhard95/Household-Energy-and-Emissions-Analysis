# Household-Energy-and-Emissions-Analysis

I analysed the data of a public set of an individual household's energy consumption. This dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jaganadhg/house-hold-energy-data

I also calculated the CO2e emissions for this household and used 0.879 lbs CO2e per kWh as a metric for California state energy generation emissions, as there were was no further information available about the energy provider of the household. This metric can been found here: https://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/about/environment/calculator/assumptions.pdf
